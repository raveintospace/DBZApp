However, falling off a cliff dealt him a brutal blow that almost killed him, but it altered his memory and erased all the violent instincts of his species, causing him to grow up with a pure and kind heart, while still retaining all the powers of his race. In the new Dragon Ball continuity, it is established that he was sent by his parents to Earth to survive the destruction of their planet by Frieza at all costs. Later, Kakarot, now known as Son Goku, would become the prince consort of Mount Fry-pan and leader of the Z Fighters, as well as the greatest defender of Earth and Universe 7, managing to keep them safe from destruction on numerous occasions, despite not considering himself a hero or savior.",
